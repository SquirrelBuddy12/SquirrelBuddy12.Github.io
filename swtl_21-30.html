<h3>SWTL 21</h3>
<h3>Changing Cases</h3>
<h4>Suppose we have a user who enters for a city, baltimore, instead of Baltimore. They get an error. The solution is to code the array elements in lower-case, and convert the user's input whatever it is, to lower-case, so we always have apples to compare with apples.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 22</h3>
<h3>Measuring Length and Extracting Parts</h3>
<h4>To copy a section of a string, you use the slice method.  Sometimes it's useful to know how many characters are in a string.
For example, suppose you want to slice the first three characters from any string than exceeds 
three characters in length, for example, slicing "Nov" from "November". To find the number of characters in a
string, you use the same language you've already learned to find the number of elements in an array.  
Also, being able to measure the number of characters in a string can come in handy. For example, suppose you want to loop through a string,
checking to see if it has any double spaces in it. You can use the character count as the loop limiter.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 23</h3>
<h3>Strings: Finding Segments</h3>
<h4>We can use look through a paragraph to find phrases. It is called IndexOf.
To find the last instance of a segment in a string, use lastIndexOf.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 24</h3>
<h3>Finding a Character at a Location</h3>
<h4>This is like slice only more direct. The code above finds a single character at index-0 (the beginning) of the string
represented by the variable firstName and assigns it to the variable firstChar. It keep cycling through until it finds
what it wants.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 25</h3>
<h3>String: Replacing Characters With Replace </h3>
<h4>The replace() method searches a string for a specified value, or a regular expression, and returns a new 
string where the specified values are replaced. It does not change the original string.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 26</h3>
<h3>Rounding Numbers</h3>
<h4>The Math.round function in JavaScript is used to round a number to its nearest integer. If the fractional part of the number is greater than or equal to .5, the argument is rounded to the next higher integer.</h4>

<h3>Generating Random Numbers</h3>
<h4>The random method returns a random number from 0 (inclusive) up to but not including 1 (exclusive).</h4>

<h3>SWTL 28</h3>
<h3>Converting Strings to Integers and Decimals</h3>
<h4>The parseInt() function parses a string and returns an integer.
parseInt converts all strings, including strings comprising floating-point numbers, to
integers. It it doesn't round. It simply lops off the decimals. In the
following statement, myInteger is assigned not 2 as you might expect, but 1.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 29</h3>
<h3>Converting Strings to Numbers, Numbers to Strings</h3>
<h4>The Number() function converts the object argument to a number that represents the object's value.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 30</h3>
<h3>Controlling the Length of Decimals</h3>
<h4>The toFixed() method converts a number into a string, keeping a specified number of decimals.</h4>
