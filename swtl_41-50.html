<h3>SWTL 41</h3>
<h3>While Loops</h3>
<h4>The while loop loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter41();">Go</button>	
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 42</h3>
<h3>Do While</h3>
<h4>The do/while statement creates a loop that executes a block of code once, before checking if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true. The do/while statement is used when you want to run a loop at least one time, no matter what.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter42();">Go</button>

<h3>SWTL 43</h3>
<h3>Placing Scripts</h3>
<p>Scripts calls a function which performs a calculation, and returns the result:</p>
<button onclick="chapter43();">Go</button>
<hr>	
<h3>SWTL 44</h3>
<h3>Commenting</h3>
<h4>Commenting, as you know from your work with HTML and CSS, is a way to tell the
browser to ignore certain portions of text that you include within the body of code</h4>
<button onclick="chapter44();">Go</button>
<hr>	
<h3>SWTL 45</h3>
<h3>Events: Link</h3>
<h4>The oldest and most straightforward approach to link, is inline event handling the easiest to learn, and can serve as a stepping stone to more advanced methods. Laterin the book, you'll learn the approach that's preferred by most professionals—the scripting approach.
Inline event-handling means that you combine bits of JavaScript with HTML markup.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter45();">Go</button>	
<p><a href="JavaScript:void(0)" onClick="alert('Good Morning')">Click Me</a>
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 46</h3>
<h3>Events: Button</h3>
<h4>The event handler is the same, whether you're coding a link or a button:
You press But the beginning of the code is different: input type="button" value="Click".
But the beginning of the code is different.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter46();">Go</button>
<hr>	
<h3>SWTL 47</h3>
<h3>Events: Mouse</h3>
<button onclick="chapter47();">Go</button>
<hr>	
<h3>SWTL 48</h3>
<h3>Events: Field</h3>
<h4>The keyword here is onFocus. It tells JavaScript to do something when the user clicks in
the field. The syntax is the same as for other event handlers that you've already learned to code: a
keyword, followed by an equal sign, followed by JavaScript or HTML in quotes.
After the user enters her email address—or not—and clicks outside the field or presses
the tab key to move to another field—that is, when this field no longer has the focus—you want
it to revert to a white background. You do this with the onBlur keyword, which is the opposite.</h4>
Email:<br>
<input type="text" size="30"
onFocus="this.style.backgroundColor = 'pink';"
onBlur="this.style.backgroundColor = 'black';">
<button onclick="chapter48();">Go</button>
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 49</h3>
<h3>Reading Field Values</h3>
Suppose you've included an email field in a form, and you've made it a required field.
The form has a submit button that the user clicks to submit the information that he's entered in
the form. This is the markup that creates the form. 
<form>
Email:
<input type="text" id="email">
<input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>
<button onclick="chapter49();">Go</button>
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 50</h3>
<h3>Setting Field Values</h3>
<p>This example shows how an "onblur" event works.</p>
<p>Write something in the input field, and then click outside the field and you lose focus (blur).</p>
<input type="text" onblur="myFunction()">
<button onclick="chapter50();">Go</button>
