<h2>Why We Started Magic Crystals Ice Cream Shop</h2>
<p>We knew customers wanted a fresh taste that was free from preservatives. It also has more nutrients as well because of the way it is made! I was very excited when I heard about Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream, as it is easy to make and is gaining popularity in restaurants. It was an easy transition from my traditional soft serve and mix-in business. I have been in the ice cream shop and dessert catering business for 10 years and am always looking for a new taste. Plus, we wanted to have a unique ice cream experience by putting crystals on it, our own sugar crystals that we make on site, hence the name Magic Crystals!</p>
<h2>History of Ice Cream</h2>
<p>The manufacture of Ice Cream as we know it, in the US started, in 1851 by a Baltimore milk dealer named Jacob Fussell. With the Industrial Revolution, Ice Cream production began as a business with the invention of electricity which created refrigeration, and then cars and trucks.  Delivery trucks for business expanded business greatly. Today's total frozen dairy annual production in the United States is more than 1.6 billion gallons.</p>
<p>
Ice Cream Parlors cropped up in the 1940's, and were very popular, but by the 1960's they began disappearing. Baskin-Robbins was the first to offer many varieties of ice cream. Prepackaged ice cream was sold through supermarkets. Places such as Baskin-Robbins, have merged with Dunkin Donuts, and specialty ice cream shops have also developed. Avant-Garde Chefs have hastened this development with Molecular Gastronomy, which studies the physical and chemical processes that occur while cooking. The purpose of Molecular Gastronomy is to investigate and explain the chemical reasons behind the transformation of ingredients, as well as artistic components. Shops and restaurants have flourished as a new generation of ice cream lovers are making new varieties of ice cream such as Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream and Ice Cream Rolls.</p>
