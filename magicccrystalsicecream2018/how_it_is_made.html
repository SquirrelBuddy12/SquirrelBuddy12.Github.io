<h2>How it's Made</h2>
<h2>Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream</h2>
<p>
It takes five minutes to make this ice cream. You don't need an electric ice cream maker. All you need is a little liquid nitrogen (-320°F), some creamy ingredients, and a desire to make new desserts!
</p>
<p>
Using liquid nitrogen to make ice cream is not new. Science teachers have been making instant ice cream much for their students for years. It creates lots of fog and smoke.
</p>
<p>
Liquid Nitrogen Basics
The actual “how to's” of making Liquid Nitrogen Ice Cream are easy. You may remember from Science Class that most of the air we breathe is nitrogen (about 78%) with 20% being oxygen and the remaining 2% a potpourri of gases. Liquid nitrogen is -320°F or -196°C. While Liquid Nitrogen is used for many temperature-related applications, it's particularly useful for freezing foods because nitrogen is odorless, colorless, and tasteless.
</p>
<p>
Safety is Important!
There is one little negative to using Liquid Nitrogen to make ice cream, it's dangerous if you're not careful. If you touch the stuff, you can easily freeze tissue and cause severe damage. That's why it's not readily available to the public, and you'll need to get some basic training on how to handle Liquid Nitrogen before you start. 
</p>
<p>
Go to your local High School or University and pay a visit to the Science Department. Ask around to find out who does the science demos with Liquid Nitrogen and ask if you can come in as a spectator to watch. You'll learn a lot from watching someone who has experience handling Liquid Nitrogen.
</p>
<p>
Where to Buy Liquid Nitrogen
It's not as easy as going to the grocery store to buy eggs. Liquid Nitrogen must be stored and transported in a special container called a Dewar, otherwise it will evaporate very quickly. Your best bet is to search Google for a supplier of Liquid Nitrogen. Because of liability issues, you probably will not find too many people who are likely to just give you a container of LN2 (short for Liquid Nitrogen), and you'll need to buy it from a company who distributes it. Many times these companies will let you borrow or rent a 5-liter Dewars to transport it. You can budget about $1.50 to $2.00 a liter and you'll need about 5 liters to make up a couple of quarts of Ice Cream.
</p>
<p>
<h3>The Recipe</h3>
<p>There are hundreds and hundreds of recipes for Ice Cream, so you'll just need to find one that you like. But one of the benefits of making ice cream using Liquid Nitrogen is that you can test the batch in just a few minutes. Here's a basic recipe to which you can add anything to make your signature Ice Cream.
</p>
<p>Make a small batch of Ice Cream until you master the mixing technique. The general rule is to use twice as much cream as milk and sweeten to taste with vanilla and sugar.
</p>
<ol>
<li>In a large steel bowl, mix one quart of Half and Half with one pint of milk.</li>
<li>Add vanilla and Sugar. Stir until the sugar dissolves.</li>
<li>At this point, you can add anything you like – get creative. It's easy to replace the vanilla with any flavor you wish. Add chocolate chips, crunch up a candy bar, toss in frozen berries, nuts, marshmallows, cookie dough, whatever sounds good to you!</li>
<li>It's time for the Liquid Nitrogen. Put on your safety glasses and gloves. Anyone helping should also be wearing their safety gear. You might want to put a bowl in your sink just in case it overflows (which it probably will) or spread out some plastic on the table. It's impossible to measure how much Liquid Nitrogen to add, so just pour about a quart (that's equal to about 1 liter) of Liquid Nitrogen into the bowl. Expect lots of cool fog.</li>
<li>DO NOT STIR THE MIXTURE. Let the Liquid Nitrogen do its job of partially freezing the mixture. If you stir too soon, it will bubble over and you'll have a mess.</li>
<li>Stir the mixture with a wooden spoon. Some of the cream will be completely frozen while other parts will still be liquid. Keep stirring until you have a consistent mixture, and then add more Liquid Nitrogen.</li>
<li>Let it freeze for a few seconds before stirring.</li>
<li>Stir, stir, and stir some more until you have a consistent mixture.</li>
<li>Keep adding small amounts of Liquid Nitrogen until you have the perfect creamy consistency.</li>
</ol>
<h3>How Does It Work?</h3>
<h3>The Science Behind the Freeze</h3>
<p>The secret to the creamy ice cream is all in the rapid freezing of the mixture. The Liquid Nitrogen causes the fat and the water particles to stay very small, giving the ice cream it's creamy consistency. The goal is to avoid ice crystals – similar to what you get when you make ice milk. According to food science experts, rapid freezing preserves the nutrients in food (a quick-frozen vegetable that's three months old will likely have a nutrient composition closer to harvest levels than a five day old fresh vegetable. The faster you freeze, the less you destroy tissue structures that could lead to a more rapid loss).</p>
