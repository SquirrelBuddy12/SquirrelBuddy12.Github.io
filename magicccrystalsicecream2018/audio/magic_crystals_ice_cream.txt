I’m Rebecca Leo, Owner of Magic Crystals Ice Cream Shop.  I lived in Maine and loved the wild blueberry pie available in Bar Harbor. I wanted to create an ice cream with the same taste of those wild blueberries. What  goes better with wild blueberries, chocolate of course? A deep rich chocolate with 90%  supreme dark chocolate excellence.  So now you don’t have to go to Maine to enjoy wild blueberries! 
Thanks for listening! If you like my flavor, wild blueberries and chocolate, please like me on Twitter and Instagram. Next week I will be talking about the challenges and fun of making Nitrogen Oxide Ice Cream. If you want to know more, please visit my website, www.magicrystalsicecream.org.
