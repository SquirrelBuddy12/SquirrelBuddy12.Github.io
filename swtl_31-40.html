<h2>Smarter Way to Learn 31-40</h2>
<h3>SWTL 31</h3>
<h3>Getting the Current Date and Time</h3>
<h4>By default, JavaScript will use the browser's time zone and display a date as a full text string.</h4>
<p id="demo87"></p>
<button type="button" onclick="chapter88()">Test Input</button>
<br>
<hr>	
<h3>SWTL 32</h3>
<h3>Extracting Parts of the Date and Time</h3>
<h4>Let's look at the rest of the extraction methods. Like
getDay, getMonth gives you not the spelled-out name of the month shown in the Date object,
but a number. The following code produces a month number ranging from 0 for January through
11 for December.</h4>
<button type="button" onclick="chapter88()">Test Input</button>
<br>
<hr>	

<h3>SWTL 33</h3>
<h3>Specifying a Date and Time</h3>
<h4>Creates a JavaScript Date instance that represents a single moment in time. Date objects use a Unix Time Stamp, an integer value that is the number of milliseconds since 1 January 1970 UTC.</h4>
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 34</h3>
<h3>Changing Elements of a Date and Time</h3>
<h4>You can change individual elements of a Date object, such as setFullYear, setMonth, etc.</h4> 
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 35</h3>
<h3>Functions</h3>
<h4>A function is a block of JavaScript code that robotically does the same thing code over and over again when you call it's name.</h4>  
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>
<h3>SWTL 36</h3>
<h3>Passing them data</h3>
<h4>A function is a block of code that does something robotically, whenever you invoke its
name. For example, when you write greetUser(); a function with that name executes. To be
clear: The kind of function I'm talking about is one that you've written yourself, and named
yourself. Suppose that when you write greetUser(); a function is called that displays an alert
saying, "Hello, there."</h4>
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>

<h3>SWTL 37</h3>
<h3>Passing Data Back from Them</h3>
<h4>A function can do even more. It can pass data back to the calling code.
Let's say you charge a minimum shipping rate of $5, plus 3 percent of the merchandise
total above $50, up to $100. Also, you offer free shipping when the total hits $100.</h4>
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>

<h3>SWTL 38</h3>
<h3>Functions: Local vs. Global Variables</h3>
<h4>Now we come to the subject of variable scope. That is, the difference between global
and local variables. Some variables have global scope, which makes them global variables.
Other variables have local scope, which makes them local variables. 
A global variable is one that's declared in the main body of your codeâ€”that is, not inside
a function.
A local variable is one that's declared inside a function. It can be either a parameter of
the function, which is declared implicitly by being named as a parameter, or a variable
declared explicitly in the function with the var keyword.</h4>
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
<br> 
<hr>


<h3>SWTL 39</h3>
<h3>Switch Statements: How to Start Them</h3>
<h4>The switch statement is used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
Use the switch statement to select one of many code blocks to be executed.</h4>
<input type="button" value="Click" id="button1">
