	<h2>Smarter Way to Learn 51-60</h2>
<h3>SWTL 51</h3>
<h3>Reading and Setting Paragraph Text</h3>
<h4>Your webpage initially displays a picture of a little mammal known as the slow loris,
along with a single sentence: Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
Nycticebus. Click for more. When the user clicks the link, the paragraph expands:
Slow lorises are a group of several species of strepsirrhine primates which make up the genus
Nycticebus. They have a round head, narrow snout, large eyes, and a variety of distinctive coloration
patterns that are species-dependent. An id is assigned to the paragraph, which will be used by the function. When the user
clicks the link, a function, expandLoris, is called.
This is the function.

<h3>SWTL 52</h3>
<h3>Manipulating images and text.
<h4>This is an event handler to make an image bigger.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter52();">Go</button>	
<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 53</h3>
<h3>Swapping Images</h3>
<h4>You've been learning how to read the properties of HTML elements, and also how to
change those properties using various statements that incorporate the magic words
document.getElementById.... For example, the following function removes the original
image, with the id of "before," and replaces it with a second image, "after-pic.jpg."</h4>
<button onclick="chapter53();">Go</button>	
<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 54</h3>
<h3>Swapping Images and Setting Classes</h3>
<h4>In Chapter 52 you learned how to add a css class to any element to change its styling. For
example, this function adds the class "big" to an element. If, for example, the new class, "big,"
specifies a larger font size for the element than it has originally, the result is that the text inside
the element gets bigger and the styles are not removed.</h4>

<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 55</h3>
<h3>Setting Styles</h3>
<h4>Getting an image to float to the left.</h4>  
document.getElementById("pic99").style.cssFloat = "left";
<button onclick="chapter55();">Go</button>	
<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 56</h3>
<h3>Target All Elements By Tag Name</h3>
<h4>Suppose you want to give your users the option of doubling the size of the text in all the
paragraphs of the document. To accomplish this, you could give each paragraph an id. When
the user clicks the Double Text Size button, a function would cycle through all the paragraph
ids and make the change. The function could upsize the font either by assigning a new class to
each paragraph, with the class specifying a larger font size, or it could assign the new style
property directly.</h4>
<button onclick="chapter56();">Go</button>	
<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 57</h3>
<h3>Target Some Elements by Tag Name</h3>
<h4>You have learned about making arrays in a document that have a particular tag name. For example, a statement
can make a collection of all the paragraphs in the document and assigns the collection to the variable pars.
You also learned to read or set the properties of any of the elements in a collection of
elements by using array-like notationâ€”a number in square brackets. For example, a
statement can read an element in the collection pars and assigns the
string to the a variable. But suppose you don't want a collection of all the paragraphs in the document. Suppose
you want just a collection of all the paragraphs within a particular div.</h4>

<h3>SWTL 58</h3>
<h3>The DOM</h3>
<h4>With the HTML DOM, JavaScript can access and change all the elements of an HTML document.</h4>
<h3>SWTL 59</h3>
<h3>The DOM: Parents and Children</h3>
<button onclick="chapter59();">Go</button>	
<hr> 
<h3>SWTL 60</h3>
<h3>The DOM: Finding Children</h3>
<h4>Welcome to the most fundamental way of designating nodes of the Document Object
Model (DOM). You can designate any node of the DOM by saying the node is the xth child of a
particular parent. You can also designate a node by saying it's the parent of any child.</h4>
var d = document.getElementById("div3");
var p = d.getElementsByTagName("p");
var contents = p[2].innerHTML;
