<ul>
<li><strong>Personal Background:</strong> I grew up in Pennsylvania, moved to Boston, MA and got married, then moved to Washington, D.C and Fairfield, IA and pursued a Sales Career.
Moved here with my boyfriend from Austin, TX a year ago. I have had numerous cats, a dog and a South American frog!</li>
<li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have a BA in Interdisciplinary Studies. I also have a Certification in Web Development from
Austin Community College, 2016. I studied Bootstrap on my own in 2017. I have done everything from Canvassing to working for the IRS. I sold
software for a Commercial Appraisal company and also have worked in Telecommunications.</li>
<li><strong>Professional Goal:</strong> I would like to be a UX Designer, I love dealing with the user experience of websites.</li>
<li><strong>Primary Computer Platform:</strong> Windows 10, I have an ASUS Chromebook, an HP Laptop, and an ipad mini.</li>
<li>
	<strong>Reason For Taking Each Course:</strong>
	<ul>
		<li>WEB 115: Web Markup and Scripting: I want to learn as much as I can about web design!</li>
		<li>CTI 130: OS and Device Foundation: I need it for my degree and I am looking forward to putting together computers too.</li>
		<li>DBA 120: Database Programming 1: SQL is a good skill to have and the professor is enthusiastic about his subject.</li>
	</ul>
<li><strong>Interesting Item To Remember Me By:</strong> I do Ballet 2 times a week. I have been doing it only since 2014. It's hard work,
but it burns so many calories it enables me to eat my gourmet desserts now!
