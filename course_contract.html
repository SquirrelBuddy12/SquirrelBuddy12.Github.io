<body><h1>Course Contract</h1><br>
I, Rebecca Leo, agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2018, WEB-115-85, Web Markup and Scripting, with my Instructor, Professor D.I von Briesen.
I understand that all work that I do on my school and personal website will be publicly available to the world, and will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absenses.

<p>Signed, Rebecca Leo, 1/13/2019</p>
